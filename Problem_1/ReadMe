Problem:
 Develop a java project in which given ip address needs to be pinged after their given time using multithreading concepts.

 Solution:
  I have created five classes:
    1> BootManager - The main class in which every class is called and threads are created.
    2> GlobalConfiguration - This class contains all the data structures that is going to be used.
    3> Scheduler - Thread which is going to be executed(run) after every 10 seconds.
    4> CollectorService - Thread which takes the ip address from user and perform ping operation.
